# Spotify Song Recommendation Project

## About

This project takes a playlist and generates recommendations using Spotify's breakdown of song characteristics. The dataset was pulled from kaggle.com, however the page no longer exists.

## The files

This is a more finalized version of a school project. The SpotifyProject.ipynb file contains the code that was turned in for the project with a few updates since then. The julia files are just a reorganization of that original .ipynb file with a few changes. The getRecs.jl file is entirely new. It's purpose is to make actual process of getting song recommendations a little easier.
